Instructions
------------
1. Extract the release package and move cypress folder to $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/vendor/.

2. Apply or porting the Android patches in $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/vendor/cypress/aosp-patches.

3. Follow build steps in NXP Android_User's_Guide.pdf.
   We build FMAC modules in imx-make.sh because Google started to put a limit on the host tools
   used when compiling Android code from Android 10.0, and host tools for building FMAC modules
   now cannot be used in the Android build system.
	$ source build/envsetup.sh
	$ lunch evk_8mq-userdebug
	$ ./imx-make.sh

4. Re-flash following images in $OUT folder
	a. boot.img
	b. dtbo-imx8mq.img
